	<h1> Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity means how the time taken by a program grows when the input size grows.
	The efficiency of time complexity means how well an algorithm handles bigger inputs.
The smaller (or slower-growing) the time complexity, the more efficient the algorithm is.</p>
	
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> means how much memory (RAM) an algorithm needs as the input size grows.
	
	O(n)  in the sppace complexitymeans the work (space) grows in direct proportion to the input size.
