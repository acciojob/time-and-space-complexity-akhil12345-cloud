	<h1> Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity tells us how efficient an algorithm is when solving a problem as the input size grows.</p>
	
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> means how much memory (RAM) an algorithm needs as the input size grows.
	<ol>O(N) means the work (space) grows in direct proportion to the input size.</ol>
		<ol>Example:</ol>

Suppose you have N students and you want to store their names in a list.

<ol>For 10 students → you need space for 10 names.</ol>

<ol>For 100 students → you need space for 100 names.</ol>

<ol>For N students → you need space for N names.</ol>

<ol>So the memory grows in linear proportion → that’s O(N) space</ol>
