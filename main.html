	<h1> Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity means how much time taken for executing the code if u write more efficient code then your Time complexity will reduce</p>
	
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> means how much memory (RAM) an algorithm needs as the input size grows.
	
	O(n)  in the space complexity means the work (space) grows in direct proportion to the input size.</p>
