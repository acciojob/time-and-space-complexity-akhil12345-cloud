	<h1> Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity means how the time taken by a program grows when the input size grows.
	The efficient of time complexity means how well an algorithm handles bigger inputs.</p>
	
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> means how much memory (RAM) an algorithm needs as the input size grows.
	
		<ol>

O(1) → Constant space → Algorithm uses the same memory, no matter the input size.
Example: Swapping two numbers, simple math operations.</ol>

<ol>O(n). → Linear space → Needs memory proportional to input.
Example: Storing an array of N elements.</ol>

<ol>O(n²) → Quadratic space → Memory grows very fast.
Example: Storing an NxN matrix.</ol>
